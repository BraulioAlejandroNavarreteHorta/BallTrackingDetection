# Ball Tracking and Analysis - Second Midterm Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a set of videos for the second midterm project focused on ball tracking and analysis using video processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The `RS_ActividadVideo.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook includes code for processing and analyzing video footage to track the motion of a ball. The project aims to demonstrate the use of image processing methods to track objects in videos with various background conditions.

## Contents

- `RS_ActividadVideo.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for video processing and ball tracking analysis.
- `videos/`: Directory containing sample video files used within the notebook:
  - `nuevo_rebote_fondoblanco.mp4`: Video of a ball bouncing against a white background.
  - `nuevo_recto_fondoblanco.mp4`: Video of a ball moving straight on a white background.
  - `rebote_fondoblanco.mp4`: Another bouncing ball video with a white background.
  - `rebote_fondoruido.mp4`: Bouncing ball video with a noisy background.
  - `recto_fondoblanco.mp4`: Straight-moving ball on a white background.
  - `recto_fondoruido.mp4`: Straight-moving ball on a noisy background.
 
## Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib (the installation instructions for these are provided within the notebook).

## Usage

The notebook is self-contained and includes all the required instructions and code to perform the ball tracking analysis. Follow the steps in the notebook for a guided experience.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you would like to improve the tracking algorithm or add new features, feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull request.
